6. Increase geographic talent acquisition efforts outside of Ohio to attract talent from other regions and diversify the employee base.
7. In order to inform strategies for resource allocation and workforce planning, analyse the factors that are increasing the net change in the number of      employees.
8. Based on average tenure and turnover rates, create department-specific retention initiatives, emphasising knowledge transfer and professional development for departments with low turnover rates and job satisfaction and career growth opportunities for departments with higher turnover rates.
